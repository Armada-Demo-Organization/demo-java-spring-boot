# Armada demo estate

This repository is part of the **Armada** demo estate: the set of projects the
Armada Master Template is built from, so that `armada create` hands you a
SonarQube with real projects, real findings and real history already in it.

- **Copied from:** [`SonarSource-Demos/demo-java-spring-boot`](https://github.com/SonarSource-Demos/demo-java-spring-boot) — public at the time of copying.
- **Copied, not forked.** A fork would tie this estate to the source
  organisation's network. This is a plain push of the default branch's history
  into a fresh repository, so no fork relationship exists.
- **What came across:** the default branch and its tags. The source carried
  branches of personal work-in-progress; those were left behind.

## What this one demonstrates

A small **Spring Boot** web application with tests and coverage — the
everyday Java project, as opposed to the deliberately hostile one next to
it. Good for showing coverage, new code and the quality gate on something
that looks like ordinary work.

## Please do not "fix" this code

The findings are the product. Every issue Sonar reports here is either
deliberate or inherited on purpose, and a cleanup would empty the demo.

## Pull requests

`demo/new-issue` is open as a pull request against `main`. It exists so that a
demo can show pull-request decoration: it introduces a finding that `main` does
not have, which is what gives the New Code quality gate something to fail on.
